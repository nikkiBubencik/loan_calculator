Pay Off Method Used: snowball
In this method any extra money each month would be paid to the loans with the highest interest rates first
Example: if you have 2 loans, Loan 1 is 4.5% with a $50 monthly minimum and Loan 2 is 5% with a $35 monthly minimum and you are paying $100 a month, then the extra $15 a month will go to paying off Loan 2
